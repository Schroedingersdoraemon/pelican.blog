    .. code-block:: rst

        A monk lives a lonely life - not for him the pleasures of the fleshpots,
        the laughter and merriment of convivial gatherings, the dissipations of
        high living. Rather, days of contemplation, study, and rough toil, nights
        on a hard bet in a simple cell, and the kind of self-denial that leads
        to a purification of the soul.

        That person is an ascetic who leads an existence, voluntarily of course,
        that compares in austerity, simplicity, and rigorous hardship with the
        life of a monk.
